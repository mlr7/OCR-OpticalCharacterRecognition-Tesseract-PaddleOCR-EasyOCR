# OCR-OpticalCharacterRecognition-Tesseract-PaddleOCR-EasyOCR
Using Python frameworks to extract text and table data from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. OCR works by analyzing the shapes and patterns of the letters in the image or document, then converting them into a form that a computer can understand. This technology is widely used in data entry, digitizing printed texts, data extraction for business processes, automatic number plate recognition, and more. Modern OCR systems are designed to handle complex tasks and can recognize a wide range of languages and fonts, even in challenging conditions such as low light, distorted images, or unusual fonts. They leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision techniques to achieve high accuracy.

Deep learning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of modern Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. Traditional OCR systems relied on handcrafted features and heuristics, which often struggled with complex images, diverse fonts, and noisy backgrounds. Deep learning, on the other hand, automatically learns to recognize patterns from data, making it highly effective for OCR tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract features from images, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to recognize sequences of characters in the text. Furthermore, deep learning models can be trained on large datasets, enabling them to handle a wide variety of languages, fonts, and text orientations. They can also be combined with other technologies like attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence models to further improve performance. As a result, deep learning-based OCR systems are now capable of reading text from complex images with high accuracy, making them invaluable in many applications such as document digitization, automatic license plate recognition, and text-based image search.

## Tesseract

https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/

PyTesseract is a Python library that uses Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine to extract text from images. Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine that was originally developed by HP and later adopted by Google. It is highly accurate and can recognize over 100 languages out of the box.

Key features of PyTesseract include:

Quick Start: PyTesseract is straightforward to use and can be integrated into Python scripts with just a few lines of code.

Customization: You can customize the OCR operation by specifying various parameters such as the OCR Engine Mode (OEM), Page Segmentation Mode (PSM), and the language of the text to be recognized.

Image Preprocessing: While Tesseract itself performs some image preprocessing, for best results, it is often recommended to preprocess images using other libraries such as OpenCV before passing them to PyTesseract. This can include operations such as converting the image to grayscale, applying thresholding, resizing the image, and more.

Output Formatting: PyTesseract can output the recognized text as a string, but it can also provide more detailed information such as the bounding box coordinates of the recognized text, the confidence scores of the recognition, and more.

## PaddleOCR

https://pypi.org/project/paddleocr/

PaddleOCR is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool developed by PaddlePaddle, a deep learning platform developed by Baidu. It aims to create rich, leading, and practical OCR capabilities that are battle-tested for industrial scenarios.

Summarizing the core attributes of PaddleOCR:

Rich Capabilities: PaddleOCR supports more than 80 languages for recognition. It also supports layout analysis to recognize text in complex document images, and it can recognize text in various scenarios, such as long text, rotated text, and more.

State-of-the-art Performance: PaddleOCR uses cutting-edge algorithms for text detection and recognition. For detection, it uses algorithms like DB (Differentiable Binarization), PSENet (Progressive Scale Expansion Network), etc. For recognition, it uses algorithms like CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network), STAR-Net, etc.

Easy to Use: PaddleOCR provides pre-trained models and easy-to-use APIs, making it easy to integrate into your applications.

Scalability: PaddleOCR is designed to be scalable and can be used for both small and large-scale applications.
